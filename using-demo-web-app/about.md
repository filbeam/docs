# About

The demo web app provides a nice UI into which you can upload your files and make payments, to help you to understand how the Filecoin Onchain Cloud & FWSS work.

To get started, open [https://demo.filecoin.services](https://demo.filecoin.services) and connect your wallet. You can either connect your wallet to the Filecoin Mainnet or the Filecoin Calibration Net.

_Note: You need a browser that can connect to your wallet (e.g. a Chromium-based browser with Metamask extension installed)._
