⚠️ In September, Filecoin Warm Storage was upgraded to a new version that is not supported by the upload demo app yet. The steps below do not work right now.

Open [https://fs-upload-dapp.netlify.app](https://fs-upload-dapp.netlify.app/) and connect your wallet.

_Note: You need a browser that can connect to your wallet (e.g. a Chromium-based browser with Metamask extension installed)._

💡 fs-upload-dapp is an example project implementing a simple web app for storing files via Filecoin Services and PDP. You can find the source code on GitHub: [https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp)
