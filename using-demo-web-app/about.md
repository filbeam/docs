# About

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 fs-upload-dapp is an example project implementing a simple web app for storing files via Filecoin Services and PDP. You can find the source code on GitHub: [https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/fs-upload-dapp)
{% endhint %}

The demo web app provides a nice UI into which you can upload your files and make payments, to help you to understand how the Filecoin Onchain Cloud & FWSS work.&#x20;

However, please note that  in September 2025, FWSS was upgraded to a new version that is not supported by the upload demo app yet.&#x20;

This means the following section does not work right now. The developers are working on a new version that is linked to the most recent contract.

To get started, open [https://fs-upload-dapp.netlify.app](https://fs-upload-dapp.netlify.app/) and connect your wallet.

_Note: You need a browser that can connect to your wallet (e.g. a Chromium-based browser with Metamask extension installed)._
