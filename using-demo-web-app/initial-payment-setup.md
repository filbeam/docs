# Initial Payment Setup

Once you are on the website, you need to add some funds. You will need some USDFC in order to complete this step. Head to the above section on [setting up your wallet](../getting-started/quickstart.md) to learn how to get USDFC into your wallet on Calibration Net or Mainnet.&#x20;



Once you have some funds in your wallet,  head to the "Pay Account" section and then click "Deposit" to add some funds from your wallet into the app.&#x20;





This will require a few signatures to execute. It will also take a bit of time for the transaction to finalize on chain. Once completed, your "Available Balance" should be incremented by the amout you added.
