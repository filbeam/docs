# Initial Payment Setup

Once you are on the website, you need to set up payments before you can upload files to FWSS.

1. In the Manage Storage tab, click on “Deposit & Increase Allowances” to start the process of authorizing Filecoin Services to charge your wallet for storage deals.
2. This will open your wallet with a **Spending Cap request** to approve. Change the Spending Cap value from “Unlimited” to an amount smaller than your USDFC balance and confirm the transaction.
3. After the blockchain confirms the first transaction, the app will deposit USDFC to pay for storing 10 GB for 30 days. Approve the **Deposit** transaction request in your wallet.
4. Finally, the app requires you to sign some metadata (more details about this request will follow soon). Approve the request in your wallet.

You are now all set to upload your file.
