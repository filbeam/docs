# Pricing

The pricing for Filecoin Beam is very simple. There are no pricing tiers, no monthly fees, no hidden costs or features.

{% hint style="info" %}
Filecoin Beam costs up to $14 per TiB of egress.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you consume 1 TiB of egress over a day or over a year, it will cost the same. There is no time based restriction or dependency in the pricing.

Egress will cost exactly $14 per TiB if every request is a "cache-miss" and has to be fetched from the Storage Provider by Filecoin Beam. If every request is a "cache-hit", i.e. it is cached in Filecoin Beam's global deployment, then egress back to the user will cost $7 per TiB. These are the two extremes and most users will find their egress bill somewhere between these two number per TiB of egress.

The price for Filecoin Beam may go up with new purchases. However, if you have already bought say 10 TiBs worth of egress, then you will still use it up at the price you bought it.
